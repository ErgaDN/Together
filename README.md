# **Together - Social Shopping App**

ðŸŒŸ **Connecting Small Businesses with Customers**  
**Together** is a platform designed to connect small businesses and professionals with potential customers, offering a centralized marketplace that supports Israeli businesses. Think of it as an Israeli AliExpress tailored for "blue and white" production, providing an easy-to-use interface for sellers and customers alike.

## **About the Project**

The app addresses a growing need for small businesses that lack a unified platform to organize their operations and reach a broader audience.

  - Connect with sellers directly or place orders through the app.

- **For Sellers**:

  - Update inventory and product details.
